# ⭐️🎄🎅 Advent of Code 🎅🎄⭐️

In 2023 I'll be solving all 50 AOC questions using Python (or at least attempt to if I have the time for all 50 stars). For the most part, these will be the first intuition approaches I'm taking as I don't have the time to think about more optimal solutions to the problems.
